It is very easy to run multiple Cassandra instances on the same Ubuntu machine as long as they have different IP addresses that all resolve to the local host. 
The entire 127.0.0.0/8 address block is reserved for loopback purposes so any packet sent to addresses (127.0.0.1 through 127.255.255.254) will be looped back.

	Use ping to check if the addresses resolve properly.
	Place two (or more) Cassandra instances into different folders.

Edit cassandra.yaml and replace

	Various file locations to the locations unique to the given instance of Cassandra.
	localhost to the IP address we give to that instance (like 127.0.0.2).
	Use SimpleSeedProvider and put addresses of all other Cassandra instances to the seed list to make a cluster (like - seeds: "127.0.0.2","127.0.0.3"
	Do not alter any port numbers, not helpful and not required.

Edit cassandra-env.sh, find where the JMX_PORT property is set and give it a different value (different port) for every instance of Cassandra. Otherwise instances cannot run together because of the conflicts on this port.
